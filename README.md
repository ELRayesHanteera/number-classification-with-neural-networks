##### This repo is my attempt at understanding the internal mechanisms of a neural network. I will do this by designing a neural network that can classify handwritten numbers from 0-9 using the MNIST dataset.



* The code is written in python 3.10
* Any version later than 3.10 might not be compatible with the dependencies.
